Raspberry Pi 2 Model B

1. Get NOOBS (Not NOOBS Lite)
   
   Download latest NOOBS zip from: https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/noobs/

2. Create NOOBS microSD card
   
   Unzip the NOOBS file and copy the folder to the microSD card (used an microSD to SD adapter).

   Insert the microSD card and plug in the Mouse, Keyboard and hdmi.
   
   Plug in the power with microUSB to start the boot process.
